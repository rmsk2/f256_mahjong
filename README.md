In this game the user is presented with a stack of 144 tiles. A pair of equal or compatible tiles can be removed
from the stack. The game is won, if all tiles have been removed from the playing field. 

A pair of tiles can be removed by using a mouse to click on the first tile and then on the second tile. This is only 
possible if both tiles which have been selected are "free" in the sense that they have no neighbour to the left or 
the right and no tile on top of them. Additionally the tiles have to either show the same icon or be both of a 
compatible type. There are two sets of compatible types

1. The seasons, shown as three blossoms and a snow flake
2. The flowers, shown as flowers with stems
